The lush indigenous trees and expansive green meadows give a feeling of homeliness.

Bosalo serves as a reception room, fireplace and sometimes place to sleep(for guests and children). The other section can be used as Ma’na (bed room), working place and store.

            <p style="font-size: larger;">Dorze Huts of Woven Bamboo. High in the Rift Valley Mountains in Southern Ethiopia, the Dorze people have developed a technique of splitting and weaving bamboo. They use it to make fences and baskets, coat it with clay to make storage pots, even make bee hives out of it, but most importantly, they make whole houses from it.It takes a lot of preparation, the bamboo is not used in the round, as for many Malaysian houses, but split, flattened out, and then the pith is removed. This makes the pieces flexible enough to be woven between uprights, set into the ground and then gradually added to as the height rises. Eventually the builder will start to pull the pieces in and weave rings of decreasing size until they are finally closed with a crown, woven separately on the ground.
            Cheaper houses are then thatched with wheat or barley straw, but the best are covered with bamboo sheaths, the base of the leaves that crows around the culm. There is a myth, propogated by local tour guides, that they are covered with banana leaves, for a variety of banana is ideed grown locally. It does not friut but a bread can be made from the fermented pulp from the leaf ribs, but it is not durable enough to cover a house. However the bamboo leaf sheathes can last 10-20 years.
