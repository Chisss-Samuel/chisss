        When you set out to have your house built or reroofed, you may want to consider the type of roof you will have built. Roofing is one of, if not the most important components of a house. We donâ€™t spend enough time being appreciative of their importance, but a roof is the only part of the house that provides shelter. This gives it a tremendous responsibility, and demands durability, integrity and longevity.
<br>
        Some factors that may influence your decision will be :
        <br>
        Longevity: How long it will last for.<br>
        Compatibility: Will the roof framing be able to support the weight of the roof?<br>
        Roof Slope: Considering the materials and weather, will the roof be able to channel water property.<br>
        Design: Will the look of the roof fit in well with rest of the property.<br>
